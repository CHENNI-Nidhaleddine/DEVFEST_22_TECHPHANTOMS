<h3 align="center">Eldery Fall Detection</h3>

  <p align="center">
This Repository is for the model proposed by Tech Phantoms Team during the devfest22
    <br />
    <br />
Falls that are not detected in time are a major health risk for the elderly. With today's home automation or smart sensors, in 6 out of 7 falls, someone is only there after 5 minutes to help the client. In addition, healthcare personnel are inundated with false alarms.
